decent.im
=========

Started with Ubuntu running just Prosody XMPP server.

Added gateways to other IM networks later.

Skype gateway (x11-plugins/pidgin-skypeweb): outdated = broken

Gateway software (net-im/spectrum) provides only Debian packages (not compatible with Ubuntu) and Fedora-based docker images



friend's project with Symfony
=============================

requires very recent ICU, not available as deb packages at all. Needed version was available in Gentoo and some RPM repo (SUSE?)
